</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Facial recognition is an incredible development in computer vision and artificial intelligence, and it's become widespread enough to the point that it's being implemented in iPhones, store surveillance cameras, law enforcement, and more. However, the technology retains a great deal of mystery to those outside of the field of computer vision and machine learning surrounding how it actually works.</p>
<p>In recent years, facial recognition systems have recieved criticism for their underperformance on women and people of color, and as a result the need for examination of this technology is at an all-time high. That being said, there tends to be two sides to the argument surrounding racial and gender bias in facial recognition. One side tends to focus solely on the historical context that facial recognition algorithms are placed within, while the other focuses on technical issues.</p>
<p>Most of the time, those examining historical context have little understanding of how facial recognition technology actually works, and those examining technical issues have little understanding of the extent of the history of oppression of minority groups in America. Therefore, the goal of this site is to connect those two sides, providing both an inspection of the potential technical weaknesses in facial recognition and an examination of the effects historical context may have on this technology.</p>                </article>
