</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Why?</h1>
<p>Due to the biases detailed in the <a href="https://hagwunobi21.github.io/biasfacialrecognition/overall-biases.html">bias section</a>, the widespread usage of facial recognition technology already raises serious concerns; however, this is complicated even further by law enforcement's usage of facial recognition to identify suspects.</p>
<p>People of color have been exploited and targeted by law enforcement in America for hundreds of years, so it's not difficult to image this technology allowing for a dangerous new avenue of police brutality and harassment, especially due to its lack of accountability and obscuration from the public view.</p>
<p>There are almost no federal regulations on facial recognition technology, and none of the information about how it's used by law enforcement has been made available to the public. Most facial recognition systems also don't require consent for searches being run against your photos; since government usage of the technology often involves comparing faces against driver's license databases, law-abiding citizens are involuntarily subject to the use of facial recognition software without warrants or notification.</p>
<p>Even the supposed "fact checking"¬ù of face recognition software results is done by untrained officers, who have been found to almost 50% of the time make the wrong classification themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, facial recognition could also easily be turned into face surveillance by the government, which would consist of turning every government camera into a facial recognition system cataloguing the movements of Americans. This would put protesters at risk of having their identities exposed, as well as being a huge violation of privacy civil rights. Thus, many organizations such as the ACLU are calling for a moratorium or at least strict regulation on that  kind of technology.</p>
<h1>What Would It Look Like?</h1>
<p>There have been many proposals for how to regulate this kind of technology, such as this <a href="https://www.perpetuallineup.org/appendix/model-police-use-policy">model police facial recognition use policy</a>. However, the condensed staples of these proposals are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transparency: The public should be able to easily access information about the performance of different facial recognition software, and this information should be made available in a simplified and easily understandable way</li>
<li>User consent: Cameras in public spaces with facial recognition software enabled should be explicitly labeled as such, and police should need warrants or written consent to run your image through facial recognition technology</li>
<li>Performance: Facial recognition software should be required to maintain at least a standardized level of accuracy for all racial groups in order to be used by law enforcement</li>
</ul>                </article>
